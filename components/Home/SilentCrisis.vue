          Each year, over <span class="font-bold">250,000 infants die</span> in
          Nigeria, many from preventable causes like jaundice, malnutrition, and
          missed vaccinations. In many rural communities, mothers face a dire
          lack of support—few health workers, limited connectivity, and minimal
          access to timely advice or emergency care. MobiBaby bridges this gap,
          ensuring that every mother has the tools and information she needs to
          care for her newborn with confidence.
